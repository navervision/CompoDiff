## ‚≠ê Overview

CompoDiff is a model that utilizes diffusion models for Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) for the first time.

The use of diffusion models has enabled the introduction of negative text and inpainting into CIR for the first time.

Moreover, since it operates based on the image feature space of the CLIP-L/14 model, it can be used with various text-to-image models (such as [Graphit](https://huggingface.co/navervision/Graphit-SD), [SD-unCLIP](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-unclip), and [unCLIP (Karlo)](https://huggingface.co/kakaobrain/karlo-v1-alpha-image-variations)).

We overcame the challenge of collecting training data for CIR by generating a new SynthTriplets18M dataset. We are eager to release it soon and hope it will benefit the CIR research community.

We believe that CompoDiff has great potential to contribute to the advancement of CIR and look forward to seeing how it performs in the field.

## üöÄ NEWS

- 04/28/2023 - CompoDiff-Aesthetic released!

## üñºÔ∏è CompoDiff-Aesthetic

In this repository, we first release CompoDiff-Aesthetic model, which is one of the variations of CompoDiff.

For text guidance, we used the textual embeddings of CLIP-G/14 trained by [open_clip](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip), while the generated output feature is still the visual embeddings of CLIP-L/14.

We found that the textual embedding extractor of CLIP-G/14 not only performs better than those of CLIP-L/14 but also does not significantly increase computational cost.

CompoDiff-Aesthetic was trained on high-quality and high-resolution images, and we believe it has the potential to benefit not only CIR but also various generation models.

We hope that CompoDiff-Aesthetic will be a useful addition to the research community and look forward to seeing how it performs in various applications.

## üìö SynthTriplets18M

Using text to image diffusion models, we have created a large-scale synthesized triplet dataset.

We are currently conducting some checks before releasing it publicly.

We plan to release SynthTriplets18M once we confirm that there are no social or ethical issues as soon as possible.

Please stay tuned. üòÑ

## Search and Image generation demo
We have set up a demo that can be tested in a local computing environment.

It can be executed with the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/navervision/compodiff
$ cd compodiff
$ python demo_search.py
```

Demo will be hosted at https://0.0.0.0:8000

The unCLIP model used for image generation is from https://huggingface.co/kakaobrain/karlo-v1-alpha-image-variations.

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

# build models
compodiff_model, clip_model, img_preprocess, tokenizer = compodiff.build_model()

negative_text = "low quality"

# tokenize the input_text first.
text_token_dict = tokenizer(text=input_text, return_tensors='pt', padding='max_length', truncation=True)
text_tokens, text_attention_mask = text_token_dict['input_ids'].to(device), text_token_dict['attention_mask'].to(device)

### Shotout
K-NN index for the retrieval results are entirely trained using the entire Laion-5B imageset. For this retrieval you do not need to download any images, this is made possible thanks to the great work of [rom1504](https://github.com/rom1504/clip-retrieval).
